# ChatGPTPayClone

ChatGPTPayClone is a ChatGPT clone with integrated USDC micro-payment system. Built with Next.js and React, the clone mimics the capabilities of ChatGPT, enabling immersive, real-time text conversations. The monetization model centers around a top-up system, where users pay with USDC to access chat services. Solana Pay is integrated into the system for efficient and reliable transaction processing.
